This research developed advanced signal processing techniques for source separation in complex acoustic environments, addressing critical challenges in real-world applications where traditional static approaches fail in dynamic, multi-source scenarios. The work demonstrates how sophisticated algorithms can adapt in real-time to changing conditions, providing superior performance.
