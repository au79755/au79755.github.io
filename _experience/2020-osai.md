I led a strategic initiative to revitalize and grow the campus open-source community during the challenging transition to a fully remote environment.

### Key Contributions
* **Onboarding & Education:** Enhanced a new onboarding curriculum with tutorials on Git, Bash, and the command-line interface (CLI) to lower the barrier to entry and accelerate the productivity of new contributors.

* **Digital Engagement Strategy:** Launched a new digital engagement program to sustain the community during the pandemic, establishing a successful and scalable framework for remote-only collaboration and virtual workshops.

* **Project Incubation:** Spearheaded member-led 'proof of concept' projects, from a microservice API for hyperlocal student budgeting to an AI pipeline that used web data and sentiment analysis to guide automated stock trades.
