As the co-founder and CTO, I lead the technical vision and AI research for **The Common AI, Inc.** Our mission is to deploy sophisticated agentic systems that modernize the administrative backbone of American cities, turning complex regulatory data into actionable municipal intelligence.


### **Key Responsibilities**

* **Technical Strategy:** Defining the roadmap for our **agentic AI platform**, establishing evaluation frameworks for model accuracy, and overseeing the development of secure, enterprise-grade AI infrastructure for the public sector.
* **Product Architecture:** Designing **multimodal AI pipelines** and agentic state management systems. I architected our distributed system to handle high-concurrency retrieval workflows and complex engineering diagram comprehension.
* **Team Leadership:** Building an AI-first engineering culture, mentoring developers on **agentic reasoning patterns**, and managing the technical integration of our R&D lab with broader municipal software ecosystems.
* **Execution:** Leading the development of our **AI permit review copilot**, focusing on multimodal document parsing, agentic orchestration, and the deployment of production-ready AI systems for our various municipal partners.
