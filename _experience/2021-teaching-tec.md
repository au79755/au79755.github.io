As a Technical Project Lead and Instructor for the Developing Breakthrough Projects course, I was responsible for guiding a cohort of over 20 undergraduate students through three semester-long product development cycles. The program focused on bridging the gap between theoretical engineering concepts and practical, hands-on application in machine learning, data science, and robotics.

### **Role & Responsibilities**

* **Instructor:** My primary role was to serve as the technical expert and mentor for student teams. This involved designing curriculum, leading weekly workshops, and providing one-on-one guidance to help students scope, build, and present functional prototypes. 
* **System Development:** Developed full-stack software for multi-robot platforms, focusing on real-time control, multimodal sensor (image, audio) processing, and web-based orchestration.
* **Technical Presentations:** Delivered advanced presentations on robotics and AI to diverse audiences, including graduate researchers and faculty.
