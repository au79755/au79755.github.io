I served as a mentor for the Undergraduate Research in Scientific Advancement (URSA) program over two semesters, guiding a team of five promising engineering undergraduates through a year-long research endeavor. The program's goal is to provide students with authentic research experience by pairing them with experienced graduate mentors.

### **Program Overview**

Our team's research focused on developing novel applications at the intersection of signal processing and robotics. My role was to help the students navigate the entire research lifecycle, from initial ideation to final presentation.

### **Mentorship Activities**

* **Project Scoping:** Collaborated with students to define a research question, establish clear objectives, and create a project timeline.
* **Technical Guidance:** Provided expert advice on algorithm design, experimental setup, and data analysis in signal processing and robotics.
* **Professional Development:** Conducted weekly meetings to review progress, troubleshoot challenges, and coached students on scientific communication and presentation skills.
