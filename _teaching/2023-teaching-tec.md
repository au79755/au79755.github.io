As a Technical Project Lead and Instructor for the Developing Breakthrough Projects course, I was responsible for guiding a cohort of over 20 undergraduate students through three semester-long product development cycles. The program focused on bridging the gap between theoretical engineering concepts and practical, hands-on application in machine learning, data science, and robotics.

### **Role & Responsibilities**

My primary role was to serve as the technical expert and mentor for student teams. This involved designing curriculum, leading weekly workshops, and providing one-on-one guidance to help students scope, build, and present functional prototypes. I also delivered advanced presentations on emerging topics in robotics and AI to graduate-level researchers, fostering a collaborative learning environment.

### **Topics Covered**

* Spectral Analysis & Signal Processing
* Automated Data Collection & Processing
* Fundamentals of Machine Learning Models
* Real-time Control Systems for Robotics
