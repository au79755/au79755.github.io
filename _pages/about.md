I'm the co-founder and CTO at *The Common AI, Inc.*, where I build AI systems to solve hard problems, turning deep tech into real-world products. [Check us out](https://www.thecommonai.com/).

My background is a mix of deep tech and practical software engineering. On the **AI/ML** side, I've worked on everything from R&D in **generative AI** and **multimodal data fusion** to analyzing model bias. On the software side, I'm a full-stack developer who's modernized enterprise systems, designed scalable web architectures, and built complex data integration pipelines.
