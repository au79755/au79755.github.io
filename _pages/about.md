I'm the co-founder and CTO at *The Common AI, Inc.*, where my focus is on execution: turning novel AI concepts into robust, scalable products that create tangible value. [Explore our platform](https://www.thecommonai.com/).

I bring a full-spectrum technical background to the table. As a leader, I guide our strategy in **generative AI** and **multimodal R&D**. As a hands-on engineer, I ensure we build with discipline, architecting the complex data pipelines and resilient cloud infrastructure necessary to ship innovative technology that works.
