I’m the co-founder and CTO at **The Common AI, Inc.**, a Texas-based innovation lab building the next generation of agentic GovTech for SLED. Our mission is to accelerate the administrative backbone of American cities, nationwide.

My current focus is the rollout of our **multimodal AI copilot for permitting and licensing**. We’re also scaling our industry footprint through partnerships and events like the upcoming **APA National Planning Conference**.

Previously, I was a researcher in AI, Machine Learning, and Robotics at the **University of Illinois**, where I was a recipient of multiple fellowships and my work was featured in popular tech press.
