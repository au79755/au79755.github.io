This research and development project focused on creating a defensible technological asset by moving beyond standard AI applications. The goal was to build a "deep tech" solution with potential applications in sectors like aerospace, industrial manufacturing, and smart infrastructure.

### The Challenge
Conventional signal processing methods for noise cancellation often fail in complex, dynamic environments. The challenge was to design an AI model that could understand the underlying physics of a space to actively negate noise with higher efficacy.

### Solution
A physics-informed neural network (PINN) in PyTorch, that unlike traditional models, integrates physical laws into its learning process, allowing it to adapt and perform robustly in real-world conditions.
