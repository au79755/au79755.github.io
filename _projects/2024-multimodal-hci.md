This project created a robust voice interface for **Edge/IoT** devices (wearables, hearables) by using **AI/ML** to overcome noisy, real-world environments.

* **Multimodal Sensor Fusion:** Engineered an AI model to intelligently fuse data from many specialzed sensors, creating a clear signal where a single sensor would fail.

* **Generative Audio Enhancement:** Used a generative AI to reconstruct the full signal spectrum from the fused sensor data, dramatically improving clarity for better **HCI**.

* **Forward-Looking R&D:** Conceptualized and explored a novel approach using **LLMs** to perform real-time transcription, then leveraging the text to contextually guide and refine the final speech enhancement.

### Tech & Skills
