This project was a complete overhaul of a mission-critical, legacy management system at KK Stevens Publishing Co. It demonstrates core software engineering principles in a corporate environment.

### The Challenge
The existing system was a collection of outdated tools that created **siloed data**, making it difficult to access and manage information across the company. This inefficiency created a bottleneck that limited throughput. The challenge was to architect a new, unified full-stack solution with minimal disruption to business operations.

### My Solution
I led the development of a modern, web-based management platform that centralized the previously siloed data. This involved gathering stakeholder requirements, designing the system architecture, and implementing both the backend logic and the frontend user interface. This project paved the way for the removal of expensive underutilized legacy native solutions and faster process innovation in the future.

### Tech & Skills
