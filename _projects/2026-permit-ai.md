To accelerate the administrative backbone of American cities, I engineered a multimodal multi-agent system for high-stakes regulatory reviews. This architecture functions as an orchestrated reasoning engine that can be rapidly retooled for varied municipal departments.

### The Challenge
Regulatory review is a significant manual bottleneck because it requires concurrent analysis of highly disparate data types. A reviewer must simultaneously interpret vast, text-based municipal codes and ground those rules into the spatial constraints of technical engineering drawings.

### The Solution
I architected a multi-agent orchestration layer that employs a hierarchical strategy to decompose complex municipal codes and engineering plans into granular, actionable constraints. This allows specialized agents to independently validate domain-specific rules, such as zoning or fire safety, ensuring precise cross-modal alignment while enabling rapid retooling without modifying the core logic.
